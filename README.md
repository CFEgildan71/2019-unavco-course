Material for the 2019 UNAVCO Short Course.

**Instructors:** 
[Paul Wessel](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/), 
[Joaquim Luis](http://w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/),

**Bring**:
Participants must **bring their own computers** (Mac, Windows, or Linux) with the
required **software already installed** (see [Installing](installing) below).

This 2-day course will cover the use of Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) in geodesy 
using UNIX shell scripting. Lectures and exercises will be given to teach the 
basic conventions of using GMT, such as plotting grids, images, and vector data 
(points, lines, polygons). Labs will include both processing and mapping of 
various data sets relevant to geodesy.
